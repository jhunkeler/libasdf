This release also contains a preview of the libasdf-gwcs extension, which
partially supports reading `GWCS <https://github.com/spacetelescope/gwcs>`_
objects into C-native datastructures (not actually evaluating the GWCS
transforms, however).

This will later be moved to a separate libasdf extension plugin, but for this
release it is included in the main library for ease of evaluation.
