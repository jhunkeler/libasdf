libasdf 0.1.0-alpha0 (2025-11-12)
=================================

General
-------

- Preview alpha release of libasdf! Read support (only) for ASDF files; write
  support will be in a later version.

  Supports much of the ASDF 1.6.0 standard, albeit with the following key
  features still missing:

  * Reading compressed block data
  * ndarrays with inline data
  * ndarray masks
  * ndarrays with compound datatypes
  * External block data for ndarray is not supported yet

    * Some preliminary support exists for parsing compound datatypes, but no
      routines exist yet for reading records/columns out of ndarrays.

  * YAML anchors in the tree
  * Not all of the core schemas are implemented yet (complex, externalarray,
    etc.)
  * ...and likely other less common minor features.

  All of these will be addressed in future releases, likely with priority based
  on demand.


Misc
----

- This release also contains a preview of the libasdf-gwcs extension, which
  partially supports reading `GWCS <https://github.com/spacetelescope/gwcs>`_
  objects into C-native datastructures (not actually evaluating the GWCS
  transforms, however).

  This will later be moved to a separate libasdf extension plugin, but for this
  release it is included in the main library for ease of evaluation.
